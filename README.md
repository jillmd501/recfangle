# Recfangle

The name has no other purpose other than the fact that it is silly and Rectangle was already taken.  This is my very first js/node contribution and it is a simple app measuring perimeter and area on a rectangle.

## API

Recfangle takes four arguments: `x`, `y`, `width`, and `heifght.`

Have oddles of fun!
